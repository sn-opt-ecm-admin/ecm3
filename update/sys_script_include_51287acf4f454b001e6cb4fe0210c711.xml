Version 1.9.9
Update set named "ECM Global Update Set CTL112017-1" 
Update set contains;
Created NEW UI Action named "Reject" with condition;  current.source_table != 'kb_knowledge' && current.state == 'requested' && (gs.hasRole('admin')) && !isApprovalMine(current)
Modified UI Action named "Reject" modified condition to be: current.source_table != 'kb_knowledge' && current.state == 'requested' && isApprovalMine(current)

Created NEW notification named "Optum Approval Request" with condition "Approval for.Task type is ECM Tasks" AND "Approval for.Short Description is NOT "Written Response Letter Review" "
Created NEW Email Template named ecm.approve.role
Created NEW Email Notification named "ECM Approval Request"
Set baseline notification named "Approval Request" to not active

Set baseline WRITE ACL named "sysapproval_approver.state" active false
Created two new WRITE ACLs named "sysapproval_approver.state
One has condition of "Source table is x_opt_ecm_tasks" with script of "answer = (current.approver == gs.getUserID());"
Second one replaces the baseline WRITE ACL with a condition of "Source table is x_opt_ecm_tasks" and Role of approval_admin.

Versions 2.x to 2.0.22 include multiple enhancements and fixes:
Changes to required fields on case.
Addition of fields such as phone number extensions and prompts.
Inquiry complaint types require no fields on case.
Add DMHC on submission source.
Additional complaint types.
Disabling 24 Hour callback notifications for groups.
Adding executive summary required field with rules on making summary field required on resolve/close
Several dot release versions are due to the publisher not behaving and prematurely ending, but
advancing the version number - forcing another publish.
2.0.20 through 2.0.21 (and some prior versions) failed to push to repository.
